clib86
======
This project is aimed to be a small, compact implementation of the standard C library targeted for x86 platforms.  All of the code will be written in x86 assembly using the Intel syntax.  With this library, the user will get to pick and choose how much of the C library they want to link with their project, which will cause executable size to drastically decrease.

Suggested assembler: nasm
Suggested linker: GNU ld
